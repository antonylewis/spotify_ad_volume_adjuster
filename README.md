# spotify_ad_volume_adjuster
This is an AppleScript that modifies the volume for ads on Spotify, intended for people who are concerned about hearing damage.

Spotify ads tend to be louder than the preceeding music, potentially causing hearing damage.
This script reduces the volume of Spotify ads (defined as any track shorter than 31 seconds) on Macs.

## To use
Open AppleScript editor (Applications -> Utilities) and paste the script in.
Adjust the VOLUMEMULTIPLE to your comfort levels.
Save the script as an 'Application' in your Applications folder.
Run the new Application instead of directly running Spotify.
